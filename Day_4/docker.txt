1. Why Docker?
    Simplifies deployment.

    Solves “it works on my machine” issue.

    Provides lightweight containers vs heavy VMs.

2. Containerization
    Packaging app + dependencies into isolated units (containers).

    Ensures consistency across environments.

3. History of Docker
    Released in 2013 by DotCloud.

    Built on LXC (Linux Containers).

    Became widely adopted due to simplicity and power.

4. Installing Docker
    Install Docker Engine for your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux).

    Use Docker Desktop or CLI.

    Verify with: docker --version.

5. Inside Docker
    Uses namespaces and cgroups (Linux features).

    Manages isolated processes in containers.

6. Images vs Containers
    Image: Read-only template (blueprint).

    Container: Running instance of an image.

7. Port Mapping
    Maps container ports to host ports.

    docker run -p 8080:80 maps port 80 in container to 8080 on host.
    docker run -p 27017:27017 mongo -> my port:docker port

8. Common Docker Commands
    docker ps, docker run, docker stop, docker rm, docker images, docker rmi, docker exec.

9. Dockerfile
    Script to create Docker images.

    Contains instructions like FROM, COPY, RUN, CMD.

10. Building Images
    Use: docker build -t myimage .

    Runs Dockerfile to produce an image.

11. Running Images
    docker run myimage

    Can attach ports, volumes, env vars.

12. Passing in env variables
    docker run -e KEY=value myimage

    Can use .env files too.

13. More Commands
    docker logs, docker inspect, docker stats, docker network.

14. Pushing to DockerHub
    Login: docker login

    Tag: docker tag myimage username/myimage

    Push: docker push username/myimage

15. Layers in Docker
    Each Dockerfile instruction creates a new layer.

    Layers are cached, reusable.

16. Layers Practically
    Use layer caching to speed up builds.

    Put frequently-changing steps at the end of Dockerfile.

17. Why Layers?
    Increases efficiency.

    Enables reusability and faster builds.

18. Optimising Dockerfile
    Minimize number of layers.

    Use .dockerignore.

    Combine commands (RUN apt update && apt install -y ...).

    Use smaller base images (e.g., alpine).

19. Networks and Volumes
    Networks: Enable container-to-container communication.

    Volumes: Persist data outside container lifecycle.

20. Volumes
    Mounts persistent storage.

    -v host_path:container_path

    Used for DBs, logs, configs.
