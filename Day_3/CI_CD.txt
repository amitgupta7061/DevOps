üöÄ What is CI/CD?
CI - Continuous Integration
A development practice where developers frequently merge code changes into a central repository, followed by automated builds and tests.

CD - Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment
Continuous Delivery: Automatically prepares and verifies code for release to production but requires manual approval to deploy.

Continuous Deployment: Automatically deploys every code change to production after passing tests, no manual step needed.

‚úÖ Why CI/CD is Needed
Problem in Traditional Workflow	Solution via CI/CD
Manual testing is slow and error-prone	Automated testing on every commit
Code integration leads to conflicts	Frequent small merges reduce conflicts
Manual deployment takes time	Auto-deploy speeds up release cycle
Bugs are caught late in production	Caught early via automated pipelines
Inconsistent environments	CI/CD ensures uniform build/test/deploy

‚öôÔ∏è How CI/CD Works (Basic Pipeline Flow)
Code Commit: Dev pushes code to version control (e.g., GitHub)

CI Trigger: A CI tool (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI) detects the commit

Build: Code is compiled or bundled

Test: Automated unit/integration tests run

Delivery Step:

In CI/CD: App is packaged and staged for release

In Continuous Deployment: Code is deployed to production instantly

üõ†Ô∏è What CI/CD Does
Continuous Integration:
Pulls latest code

Builds app

Runs tests

Reports status to team

Ensures no broken code enters shared branch

Continuous Delivery/Deployment:
Builds Docker images or artifacts

Deploys to:

Staging (in CD)

Production (in Continuous Deployment)

Sends alerts/logs for visibility
