🔧 Process Management in DevOps
What is Process Management?
In DevOps, process management refers to controlling the lifecycle of applications—starting, stopping, restarting, and ensuring they recover from failures. This is crucial for running applications reliably in production environments like AWS EC2.

⚙️ PM2 - Production Process Manager for Node.js
📌 What is the Need for PM2?
Running a Node.js or script-based app using node app.js directly has several limitations:

❌ App stops if the terminal/SSH session closes

❌ No built-in auto-restart on crash

❌ No logging or monitoring

❌ No process scaling (cluster mode)

❌ Manual restart after server reboot

✅ PM2 Solves These by:
Keeping the app alive forever

Auto-restarting apps on crash or failure

Managing logs (stdout & stderr)

Enabling monitoring (CPU, memory)

Supporting cluster mode for performance

Enabling auto-start on boot

🔌 Installation on AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)
