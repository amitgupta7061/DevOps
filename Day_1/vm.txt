🖥️ Virtual Machine (VM) – Notes
🔹 What is a Virtual Machine?
A Virtual Machine is a software emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications like a real computer. It uses the host machine’s hardware through a hypervisor (like VirtualBox, VMware, KVM).

🔹 Key Concepts:
Host OS: The real physical computer and operating system.

Guest OS: The virtual operating system inside the VM.

Hypervisor: Software that enables virtualization (e.g., VirtualBox, Hyper-V, KVM).

Uses: Testing, deployment, running multiple OSs, isolation, cloud hosting.

☁️ Setting Up a VM on DigitalOcean
🔹 What is DigitalOcean?
DigitalOcean is a cloud service provider that offers virtual machines known as Droplets.

🔹 Steps to Set Up a VM (Droplet):
Create an Account:

Go to https://www.digitalocean.com and sign up.

Create a Droplet (VM):

Click Create > Droplet.

Choose an Image (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04).

Select a Plan (Basic/Shared CPU).

Choose a Data Center Region close to your users.

Add Authentication:

Use SSH key (recommended).

Or set a root password.

Name your droplet and click Create Droplet.

Access Your Droplet:

Note the IP address of your droplet.

Use SSH from your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh root@your_droplet_ip
🔐 What is SSH (Secure Shell)?
🔹 Overview:
SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol for securely accessing and managing remote systems.

🔹 How It Works:
You connect to a remote machine via terminal using:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh username@ip_address
SSH uses key-based or password-based authentication.

🔹 SSH Key Concepts:
Public Key (id_rsa.pub): Stored on the remote server (e.g., DigitalOcean).

Private Key (id_rsa): Stored securely on your local machine (~/.ssh/).

🔹 Generate SSH Key:
bash
Copy
Edit
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
Then, copy the public key to the server:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh-copy-id root@your_droplet_ip
🔹 Common SSH Commands:
Connect:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh root@your_droplet_ip
Copy files:

bash
Copy
Edit
scp file.txt root@your_droplet_ip:/path/to/dir
Use with custom port:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh -p 2222 root@your_droplet_ip
