🌐 What is AWS?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and widely adopted cloud computing platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally.

🔑 Key Concepts of AWS:
1. Cloud Computing Models
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): e.g., EC2 (virtual servers)

PaaS (Platform as a Service): e.g., Elastic Beanstalk

SaaS (Software as a Service): e.g., Amazon WorkMail

🔷 What is Amazon EC2?
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It lets you run virtual servers (called instances) for applications.

🔧 Step-by-Step: Creating a New EC2 Server
1. Log in to AWS Console
Go to https://aws.amazon.com/console

Sign in using your AWS credentials.

2. Open EC2 Dashboard
From the Services menu, choose EC2 under the Compute category.

3. Launch a New Instance
Click "Launch Instance" to begin configuration.

4. Name and Tags
Instance Name: Give your server a name (e.g., MyWebServer)

You can add tags (key-value pairs) for identification and cost management.

5. Choose AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
This is the OS template for your instance.

Common options:

Amazon Linux

Ubuntu

Red Hat

Windows Server

📝 Ubuntu (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04) is recommended for beginners or developers.

6. Choose Instance Type
Defines CPU, memory, and networking.

Common type: t2.micro or t3.micro (eligible for Free Tier)

7. Configure Key Pair (SSH Access)
Create or select an existing Key Pair (for SSH login).

If creating new:

Name it (e.g., ec2-keypair)

Download the .pem file and store it securely

Required to SSH into your instance.

8. Network Settings
Select a VPC and Subnet (default is okay for basic setup).

Enable Auto-assign public IP.

Create or select a Security Group:

Add rules like:

SSH (port 22) – Your IP only

HTTP (port 80) – Anywhere

HTTPS (port 443) – Anywhere

9. Configure Storage
Default: 8 GB (gp3 SSD) is sufficient for most uses.

You can increase this for larger apps or databases.

10. Launch Instance
Review all settings and click Launch Instance.

Wait for instance status to become "Running".

🖥️ Connect to EC2 Server via SSH
Open terminal (Linux/Mac) or Git Bash (Windows)

Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod 400 your-key.pem
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ubuntu@<your-ec2-public-ip>
Replace your-key.pem with your actual key file.

Replace <your-ec2-public-ip> with your instance’s Public IPv4.

📝 If using Amazon Linux, user is ec2-user; for Ubuntu, user is ubuntu.

📁 Example Use Cases
Deploy web servers (e.g., Nginx, Apache)

Host applications (Node.js, Python, etc.)

Set up databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)

🔐 Security Tips
Never expose SSH to the world; restrict IP access.

Disable root login if not required.

Regularly patch OS for updates.
